VBA Homework

Module1.bas contains the VBA code for my macros.
	allSheets is the only macro that needs to be run to perform the analysis.
	allSheets calls two other helper funtions to make the calculations and format the colums for each sheet.

NOTE: There are 2 "Greatest" Tables on the first sheet. The top one is for all the data in the workbook. The bottom one is for the data in the sheet (and can be found on the other sheets as well). I wasn't sure which was desired so I included both.


Stock_2016, _2015, _2014.png are the screenshots of the Stock data after my analysis was run.
